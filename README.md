# Aucteo Hub

## Overview
Aucteo Hub is an AI-powered assistant designed to help content creators and
small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) stay consistent with content posting.
The system generates posting ideas, provides reminders, and supports business
growth through engagement improvement and grant discovery.

## Problem Statement
Many content creators and SMEs struggle with consistency due to limited time,
creative burnout, and lack of strategic guidance. Inconsistent posting reduces
audience engagement and limits growth opportunities, while many SMEs are also
unaware of grants that could support their business expansion.

## Proposed Solution
Aucteo Hub uses AI to generate tailored content ideas based on a user's profile
and goals. The system supports scheduled reminders to encourage consistency,
adapts suggestions using feedback, and recommends relevant grants to SMEs based
on matching criteria.

## Goals
- Generate relevant and actionable content ideas using AI
- Help users maintain consistent posting habits
- Improve engagement through feedback-driven updates
- Support SME growth by recommending relevant grants
